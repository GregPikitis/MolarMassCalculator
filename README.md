# MolarMassCalculator
Calculates the molar mass of any element combo or amount.

### Help
This program is very limited, as it was intended for personal use to make homework faster/easier.

My help section states:
>Very limited, sry future me. Capital and input specific. Carefull. Number of atom then element. (12H). 
>Q to quit and add all the masses up from this session.

Not kidding, even the spelling errors. Good luck.

Example:

12H+36C+3I

12H **enter**

36C **enter**

3I **enter**

**q**

This adds them together and will output the molar mass based on the values on Ms. Russo's periodic table that she says to use in her class.
